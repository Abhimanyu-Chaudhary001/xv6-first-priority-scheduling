# xv6-first-priority-scheduling
First Priority Scheduling in xv6 OS â€“ Case Study &amp; Implementation on macOS
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements First Priority Scheduling in the xv6 operating system, modifying its default round-robin scheduling to prioritize processes based on assigned priority levels. The implementation is tested and demonstrated on macOS, with a detailed case study analyzing its effects on system performance.

ðŸ”¥ Features
	â€¢	ðŸ›  Modified xv6 Scheduler â€“ Implements a priority-based scheduling algorithm.
	â€¢	ðŸ’» Runs on macOS â€“ Tested on MacBook M1 with QEMU.
	â€¢	ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis â€“ Compares default vs. priority scheduling.
	â€¢	ðŸ“– Case Study & Documentation â€“ Includes step-by-step implementation details.
